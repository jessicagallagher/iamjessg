      <p className='mx-auto mt-3 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl md:mt-5 md:text-xl font-lato text-black'>I'm originally from a small town in Louisiana called Houma. It's way down at the bottom of the boot and around 45 minutes from New Orleans. I started coding as a hobby. My first language was Ruby, and I only learned it because it was the new cool language at the time. Over the course of 5 years, I taught myself how to code basic websites and applications by volunteering with several non-profits, and after 14 years of working in various management consulting roles, I decided to make a career change so that I could finally do something that I was really passionate and excited about. So, here I am!</p>
