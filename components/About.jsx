                Originally from South Louisiana, I have a B.S. in marketing from
                LSU (Geaux Tigers!). Prior to software engineering, I worked as
                a corporate communications consultant at Gartner in Washington,
                D.C. and also at several early-stage startups in the Ed Tech
                space in New York. Working in tech allowed me to work very
                closely with the Software Engineers on my teamâ€”which inspired me
                to learn how to code. I loved solving problems with technology,
                and that motivated me to continue learning on my own and take
                advantage of several volunteer opportunities that helped
                strengthen my skills in not only website design and development,
                but also in fundraising, nonprofit management, and gained board
                experience. Like most people, my life changed during the
                pandemic. I decided to take a huge leap of faith and completely
                changed careers. I saw an opportunity to finally do what I
                loved... and now we're here!
